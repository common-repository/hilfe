HILFE AR plugin helps add more functions to banner and guidance editing , which will make it easier to manage a post of a wordpress site. 

== Description ==

A plugin that enables automatic ordering using AR/VR, compatible with various industries. This plugin displays products in 3D on Wordpress, allowing users to select multiple items and place an immediate order for shipment to a designated location. It also includes industry-specific functions such as accommodation and vehicle reservations.
AR/VR Automatic Ordering Function: By displaying products in 3D, it is easier to understand their size and image, which promotes purchasing motivation. This is a convenient tool because users can place orders immediately upon grasping the image.
If registering 3D data, upload files directly up to 10MB in size.
If 3D data is not available, there is a function to register data by attaching surface images of the product to container data within the app. (For example, if creating 3D data for a bento box, display the container data for the shape of the bento box in AR, and combine it with an overhead image of the box to register it as a product within the app. Images can be trimmed in advance or edited within the app.)
If registered as a product data, it can be used as an AR function that displays at the user's current location. If registering data for an entire building, it can be used as a VR function that allows users to grasp the inside of the building once they enter.
By displaying multiple products as a set in VR and duplicating them, they are automatically reflected in the shopping cart and can be ordered immediately.
The status of ordered products is shared and reflected as ordered ➡ shipped ➡ shipping ➡ delivered.
Vehicle Dispatch/Room Reservation Function: This plugin enables real-time confirmation of registered vehicle positions, and users can select and request vehicles. For accommodation facilities, users can select the desired facility and instantly reserve an available room in real-time. It is also possible to reserve vehicles and accommodation rooms simultaneously.
Register vehicles and allow drivers to receive requests in real-time using an IoT-registered device.
Users can request vehicles close to their current location within the app and check the current location of the requested vehicle and estimated time of arrival.
Register facilities and their respective rooms to allow for immediate reservation acceptance.
By installing IoT-registered devices at the entrance to rooms, real-time status updates can be displayed as vacant ➡ reserved ➡ occupied.
Users can reserve both vehicles and accommodation rooms simultaneously within the app.
For room reservations, passwords are issued to the facility manager and the user who made the reservation, which can be used as a key to enter the room by linking to the device.
